## For subhAShita collectors
- Are you a collector of subhAShita-s? Would you like to contribute your collection to the database? You're very welcome!
- But you should make your collection available in such a way that a machine which does not know human languages can distinguish individual quotes, ratings and various other details.
- सङ्क्षेपेण - मानुषभाषाङ्कामप्य् अनवगच्छता यन्त्रेणापि "अस्यां सुभाषितावल्यां सन्तीमे सुभाषिताः। अमुकस्य सुभाषीतस्यैते विषयाः। अस्मिन् सुभाषीते कस्यचिदियं टिप्पणिः। सुभाषितमिदम् अस्मै ५/५ इति मानेन रोचते। अपरस्मै ३/५ इति मानेन। अस्य सुभाषितस्य लेखकोऽसौ।" इति ग्राह्यं स्यात्। तेन पाठकानुकूलं संलक्ष्य भवितुमर्हति सङ्ग्रहस्य यान्त्रिक-प्रस्तुतिः।
- sa-padyas collected [here](https://github.com/subhAShita/db_toml_md_sa_padya).

## For poets
- Contributing to this database counts as publication. There will be clear public record of the contribution, with edit history. So, no need to fear theft followed by inability to prove priority.

## Publisher concerns
- Generally, no need to worry about book sale revenue. People who like books will mostly prefer that to the exclusion of this; and vice versa. Furthermore, we don't make any big announcement of new additions to the db.
- Since contributing quotes does not exactly replicate the book from where it is sourced - there is no copyright violation too. Given the big difference in format, utility and presentation - this should hold even for quote-collections/ books.
- For open-access publishing as a common practice, see [here](https://sanskrit-coders.github.io/content/books/publish/).
