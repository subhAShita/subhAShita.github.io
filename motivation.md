## Motivation
- One of the greatest (and useful) pleasures we've had in tough times is retreat for a while into the world of beautiful subhAShita-s - and then burst back out like the vRtraghna armed with dadhIchi's bones.
- I especially like online collections curated by some friends and myself:
  - since a book is not always available, and
  - I want to collect + easily access choice ones for future enjoyment.
- But it is tedious (atleast for me) to sit in front of a computer to do the following:
  - read them,
  - or scour the internet for new ones
  - or collect favorites in a spreadsheet
  - or just annotate them with comments.
- So, it is desirable to:
  - make the above as simple and easy as possible,
  - and to share our collective labor so that we can benefit more easily from each others' work.

## A Universal database
We've set out to build a **database of [subhAShita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhashita)-s (= worthy quotes)**- which is,  
at least so long as computers and internet lasts (\~200 yrs based on unexploited fuel reserves):

- **Universal**
  - Its goal is to contain within it **every worthy subhAShita**- ever composed.
  - In fact, the ambition encompasses all *languages*, *verse-* and *prose-* forms.
- **Freely and easily available**. Anyone should be able to
  - Access it
  - Export it in other formats
  - Present it in any way users will find convenient.
    - Eg. this [web-page](/saMskRtam/padyam/random), the upcoming [subhAShita-pratimAlA] app project.
- **Growing constantly in number**
  - sarasvatI still suckles some amongst us at her bosom!
- **Growing constantly in annotations/ ratings**
  - add annotations (rating, description, translations, metre, flaws, sources ...)


## Expected extensions
- We hope that this will motivate other such long-sought-after universal databases for sanskrit connoiseurs, like: one for metres.
- The clients built for this database could serve as a model for other kAvya readers.
  - Similarly, one can build a collaboratively annotated and rated collection of verses/ sentences within the context of long sequential works (rather than free floating subhAShita-s).
